The purpose of this program is to play a tank game. There are two tanks which are controlled on one computer. This allows for two players
to be able to play the game at the same time. Player 1 can control their tank movement with the keys: W, A, S, D. They can then shoot with
the space bar. For player 2, they can move their tank with the arrow keys located next to the number pad. They can also shoot by pressing
enter on the num pad. The game will continue to play until one player has won five rounds. In addition, try not to be hit by the shells
falling from the sky! Good luck! Have fun!
